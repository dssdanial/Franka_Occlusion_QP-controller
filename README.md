# Franka_Occlusion_QP-controller
QP-based control framework that unifies task-space tracking, workspace boundaries, and LOS constraints into a single optimization problem.



## Conceptual distinction (what walls vs obstacles represent)

### Walls / Workspace bounds
Represent global, static limits of where the robot is allowed to be.
- Usually known a priori, fixed, and considered hard safety boundaries (you really donâ€™t want the robot to cross them).
- Geometrically convenient: planes/half-spaces, easy to compute distance to.

### Obstacles
- Represent local, possibly dynamic objects (boxes, humans, moving robots).
- May be uncertain, tracked from sensors, and often treated as soft constraints (you can allow small relaxation/slack if necessary to preserve feasibility).

Treating them differently allows reliable, safe behavior.
